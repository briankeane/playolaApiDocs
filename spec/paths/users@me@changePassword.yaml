    Resets a user's station.  This will reset all the user's rotationItems and
    reschedule their playlist.  If they do not yet have a station running then
    it will be created and started.

    The process of starting a station could take up to 60 secs, so this endpoint
    response 200 indicating that the process has been successfully started. To
    monitor progress, poll '/users/me' until the stationStatus property no
    longer equals 'generating'. If there is an error in creating the station,
    the stationStatus will be changed to indicate the type of error, and the
    station will remain the same as before.
