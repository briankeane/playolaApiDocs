    Resets a user's station.  This will reset all the user's rotationItems
    and reschedule their playlist.  If they do not yet have a station running
    then it will be created and started.

    The process of starting a station could take up to 60 secs, so this endpoint
    response 200 indicating that the process has been successfully started. To monitor
    progress, poll '/users/me' until the stationStatus property no longer equals 'generating'.
    If there is an error in creating the station, the stationStatus will be changed to indicate
    the type of error, and the station will remain the same as before.
